# Dependencies for embedding generation (build-time only)
# These are NOT bundled into the agent-server binary
#
# NOTE: As of v0.2.5, embeddings use Ollama's nomic-embed-text model
# instead of sentence-transformers. This eliminates the torch dependency
# and ensures build-time and runtime embeddings are compatible.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Ollama installed and running (ollama serve)
#   - nomic-embed-text model pulled (ollama pull nomic-embed-text)
#
# No Python packages required for embedding generation - using Ollama API.
